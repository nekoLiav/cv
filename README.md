<h3>Project Details:</h3>
<p>This project is a part of the Full Stack JavaScript path of The Odin Project's curriculum.</p>

<h4>Version 1:</h4>

<p>The objective of this project was to learn how to pass props, manage state, and conditionally render various UI elements in React. It is a culmination of the very basic aspects of React taught in the first few lessons.</p>
<p>It is very simple by design, as I didn't want to spend too much time doing things outside of the scope of the project instructions.</p>

<h4>Version 2:</h4>

(in progress, rewrite using hooks)

<h3>Created With:</h3>
React
